# Concept Based Computing: UnaryConcept Project

This repository contains Unary Concept implementation- a subset of full functionality concept based computing capabilities. With code associated with this implementation, you can understand the power of concept based computing where anything you specify to the computer is an idea which inturn could be made up of other ideas and/or combination of other ideas recursively. With the machine help, you capture, specify and reuse human scale ideas. Thus this approach closely approximates human scale communication.

The output of this implementation that reads ideas as input is a query that is agnostic to a specific search engine syntax. The query can run on most of the popular search engines directly.

Please refer to Wiki for more information and contact us at support@ureveal.com anytime if you have any questions.

Thank you very much
